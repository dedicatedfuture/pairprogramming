# pairprogramming

Final Project at NYCDA. Working solo on this project. The object of this web application is to create a scheduling application that advanced developers can make appointments with novice developers to work on pair programming projects. Looking to create events/appointments through google calendar, then use google hangouts to share screen. The first version will meet these minimum requirements. Versions after this will add on more community functionality.
